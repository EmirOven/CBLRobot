# CBLRobot
To test the virtual environment put `test_setup.sh` in `example_ws` directory
and run `bash test_setup.sh` there. Then you can start the simulation in Unity.

To run the actual robot with this do the same with `robot_setup.sh`. (You might be able to run the script directly from this directory. If it doesn't work put it in `example_ws`)
